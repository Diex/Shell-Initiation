If you are in a Linux distribution you can do

	ls /etc/init.d 
 
and se with your own eyes all the service you OS can provide. In fact lot of them probably are already running. You computer can provide services of many kind each one of those are executed and managed by one of those programs that runs in background by the system user and are call **deamons**.

On the other side can also find lot's of clients for those services and more. A perfect match. Client and Servers all together.
