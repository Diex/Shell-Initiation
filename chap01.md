First we need to open "the gate" to this world of shadows.

	CMD + SPACE_LINE 
	"Terminal" [ENTER]

You are seen to the hostname follow by the path where you are and after all that your name.
	
	Last login: DD MMM XX HH:MM:SS on ttysXXX 
	HOSTNAME:PATH USER$		

The `$` sign tells you that it's waiting for commands.

Before starting this trip a couple of tools that are going to be handy.

### 1. TAB key
Unix it's case sensitive. That's means it's not the same to write `cd desktop` than `cd Desktop`. So you probably want to type precise commands. For that you can use the embedded auto completion. How? With your `TAB_KEY`.

For example:

	HOSTNAME:PATH USER$ cd De[TAB_KEY]
	HOSTNAME:PATH USER$ cd Desktop
	
Not just that also it let you see the different options you have
Do:

	HOSTNAME:PATH USER$ cd [TAB_KEY][TAB_KEY]
	.DS_Store		Library/		Movies/			Sites/		Applications/ 
	.Trash/			Music/			Pictures/		Desktop/	Documents/ 
	.MacOSX/		Public/			Downloads/
	HOSTNAME:PATH USER$ cd 
	
Voila! you get all the possible directories.

The same happened to the commands. Try start typing two words and it will show you all the commands that starts with that letters. Also if there are to many options it will ask you if you still want to see them.

### 2. Use history
Typing it's hard, specially when it's non-sense. So it's good to know how to go back on your steps to take a look of what you have done.

* You can use the ```history``` program:

		HOSTNAME:PATH USER$ his[TAB_KEY] 
		HOSTNAME:PATH USER$ history
	
* Also you can go through your history using the `UP_KEY`**.

		HOSTNAME:PATH USER$ [UP_KEY]
		HOSTNAME:PATH USER$ history

* If you are searching for a specific command you can find it by pressing `CONTROL`+`R`**
		
		HOSTNAME:PATH USER$ [COTROL_KEY]+r
		(reverse-i-search)`': history 
		
	Then you can type the beginning of the command and that's going to try to guess what command are you tracking.
	
* If you want to repeat your last command just type ```!!```. If you remember the exactly numbers of previous command you can do ```!-1```.

### 3. Be on CONTROL
Here you have some keyboard Shortcuts that will make you feel like a real dungeon master:

###### 3.a. Control Process
We will talk about process on the future but its good to know this from the beginning

*	`Ctrl` + `C`	Kill whatever you are running

###### 3.b. Control your entry

*	`Ctrl` + `E`	Go to the end of the line you are currently typing on

*	`Ctrl` + `K`	Clear the line after the cursor

### 4. Read the manual
Unix systems are designed for engineers as all they do the makes manuals for it. Unix have a embedded manual. Just type `man` followed by the name of the program and you will get the manual for it. Use key for navigate throughout it and after that press `q` to quit.
